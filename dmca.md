# DMCA Policy & Designated Agent

_Last updated: January 2026_

We respect the intellectual property rights of others and expect users of our Services to do the same. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), 17 U.S.C. §512, we will respond promptly to claims of copyright infringement committed using our websites, software, or related services ("Services") if such claims are properly reported to our Designated Agent as outlined below.


## 1. Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice

If you believe that material available through our Services infringes your copyright, please submit a written notice to our Designated Agent that includes all of the following information (as required by 17 U.S.C. §512(c)(3)):

1. A physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.  
2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or a representative list of such works if multiple are involved.  
3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing and information reasonably sufficient to allow us to locate the material (such as the specific URL(s)).  
4. Your contact information, including name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address.  
5. A statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.  
6. A statement that the information in the notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

Upon receipt of a valid DMCA notice, we will investigate and take appropriate action, which may include removing or disabling access to the allegedly infringing material.


## 3. Counter-Notification Procedure

If you believe that your material was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may send a counter-notification to our Designated Agent. Your counter-notice must include:

1. Your physical or electronic signature.  
2. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled, and the location where the material appeared before it was removed or disabled.  
3. A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification.

Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal district court for your address (or, if outside the United States, the jurisdiction of the federal courts located in San Francisco, California), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original DMCA notice or their agent.

If we receive a valid counter-notice, we may restore the material within 10–14 business days unless the complaining party notifies us that they have filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the allegedly infringing activity.
