# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our website and browser extensions (collectively, the "Services").
By installing or using our extensions, you agree to the practices described in this Policy.

Our goal is simple — to respect your privacy while providing useful browser tools.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect only the information necessary to operate and improve our Services.

### a. Information You Provide

* **Account or License Info:** If you purchase or activate a premium extension, we may collect your email address, license key, or other data required to verify your access.
* **Support Requests:** When you contact us, we may collect your name, email, and any information you include in your message.

### b. Automatically Collected Information

* **Extension Events:** The extension may send basic usage data (e.g., activation, error logs, feature usage) to help us improve performance and fix bugs.
* **Website Analytics:** We may use analytics tools (such as Google Analytics or PostHog) to understand aggregated usage trends — not to identify individuals.
* **No Browsing History:** Our extensions do **not** collect your personal browsing history, passwords, cookies, or form data.

### c. Optional Integrations

Some extensions may allow you to connect third-party services (e.g., Stripe for payments or Short.io for link tracking).
Any data shared with those services is governed by their own privacy policies.

## 2. How We Use Information

We use the information we collect to:

* Provide, maintain, and improve the extensions and related services
* Troubleshoot issues and deliver updates
* Communicate with users (e.g., license activation or support)
* Analyze aggregate, anonymized metrics to improve features and performance

We **do not** sell, rent, or trade user data with third parties.

---

## 3. Data Sharing

We only share information when necessary:

* **Service Providers:** With trusted vendors who assist with hosting, analytics, payments, or support — all bound by confidentiality agreements.
* **Legal Compliance:** If required by law or to respond to legal requests.
* **Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger or acquisition, data may be transferred under the same privacy protections.

## 4. Data Storage & Security

We use secure servers and encryption wherever possible to protect your data.
If data is transmitted (for analytics, licensing, or crash reports), it's sent via HTTPS and stored in secure systems.

You can request data deletion or anonymization at any time by contacting us.

---

## 5. Cookies

Our main website may use cookies or local storage for analytics, authentication, and personalization.
Our extensions generally **do not use cookies** except when necessary for login or API authentication.

---

## 6. Your Choices

* You can uninstall any extension at any time through your browser's extension manager.
* You can disable analytics or telemetry (if supported) in the extension's settings.
* You can request to delete your personal data or account by emailing **[privacy@toolmaster.tech](mailto:privacy@toolmaster.tech)**.

## 7. Children's Privacy

Our Services are intended for users aged 18 and older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors.
