# Refund Policy

All sales are final. We do not offer refunds on any products or services once a purchase is completed.

Upon successful payment, a unique license key is automatically generated and sent to the email address you provided at checkout. This grants you immediate access to the software and includes:

- Instructions for downloading and installing the product
- Walkthrough videos to help with setup
- Multiple ways to contact our support team in case you need assistance

We stand behind the quality of our products:

- If you encounter bugs or technical issues, we will work with you to resolve them promptly.
- If essential features are missing or not working as described, we will prioritize addressing them where feasible.

It is your responsibility to ensure your system meets any technical requirements before purchasing. If you're unsure, please reach out to our team before completing your purchase.

By making a purchase, you agree to this refund policy and acknowledge that:

- You are receiving immediate access to the product and license key
- Delivery is complete when the email with license and instructions is sent
- You waive any right to initiate a chargeback or dispute on the basis of non-refundability for delivered digital goods

If you have any concerns or need help with your order, please contact us. We're here to support you.
